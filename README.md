#### _Passionate in signal processing | physiological modeling | machine learning modeling | genetic circuit design_

I’m [_Pirathishanth Arudchelvan_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pirathishanth-arudchelvan). An Electronic Engineering Undergraduate, specializing in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa. I am passionate about **physiological modeling, bio-signal processing, genetic circuit design,** and **machine learning modeling.**

One of my notable projects is identifying and providing results on respiratory system and lung functioning conditions with the help of a velocity sensor, a mobile application, and our own PCB circuit created by my team, X-hale. In that project, we created an enclosure in a unique way to efficiently measure the airflow from the lungs. Currently, we are in the process of obtaining a patent for our project to explore industrial applications with the guidance of Dr. Ajith Pasqual.

In my academic background, I achieved 89th place out of 200,000+ candidates in Sri Lanka for the GCE Advanced Level exam, with A’s in all four subjects: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and English.

In my free time, I enjoy photo editing and playing musical instruments such as the guitar and miruthangam.
