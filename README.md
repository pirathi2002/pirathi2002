# 👋 Pirathishanth Arudchelvan
#### _Passionate in Signal Processing | Physiological Modeling | Machine Learning Modeling | Genetic Circuit Design_

I’m [_Pirathishanth Arudchelvan_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pirathishanth-arudchelvan). An Electronic Engineering Undergraduate, specializing in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa.

One of my notable projects is identifying and providing results on respiratory system and lung functioning conditions with the help of a velocity sensor, a mobile application, and our own PCB circuit created by my team, X-hale. In that project, we created an enclosure in a unique way to efficiently measure the airflow from the lungs. Currently, we are in the process of obtaining a patent for our project to explore industrial applications with the guidance of Dr. Ajith Pasqual.

In my academic background, I achieved 89th place out of 35,000+ candidates in Sri Lanka for the GCE Advanced Level exam, with A’s in all three subjects: Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.

In my free time, I enjoy photo editing and attending concerts in Karnatak music.
